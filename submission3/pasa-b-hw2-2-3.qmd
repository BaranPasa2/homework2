# Homework 2 Analysis 

###### [Link to Github](https://github.com/BaranPasa2/homework2)

### Part 0: Importing and cleaning the data

The data was cleaned in order to make summarizing and analysis easier. My cleaning process relied heavily on the code kindly provided to us by our TA Pablo. Additinally, data was only used from 2008 to 2015 due to my computer's lack of power.

### Part 1 Summarizing the Data
The graphs below provide a small summary of the data.
```{python}
exec(open("/Users/baranpasa/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Desktop/Emory/Junior Year/Junior Spring/ECON 470/ECON 470 Python /homework2/submission3/data_summary_v3.py").read())
```

As you can see, only the years 2008 through 2014 are visible. You can also see that there is distribution of NaN on the final graph. This is an issue that needs to be furhter addressed, and is most likely occuring to due to faulty code. 




### Part 2: Estimating ATE

```{python}
#| echo: false

from ATE2 import results
from IPython.display import display, Markdown

print(results.head())
```


display(Markdown(results.to_markdown()))
